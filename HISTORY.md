# Project Ancestry

This firmware is a rewrite of:
- the official v1.2 firmware for the [Sebsongs Euclidean](https://github.com/sebsongsmodular/Euclidean) (2022), which was based on:
- the [Tombola Euclidean Sequencer](https://github.com/sneak-thief/Tombola_Euclidean_Sequencer) (2016), which was based on:
- [Tom Whitwell's Euclidean Sequencer](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Euclidean-sequencer-) (2012).

Don't you just love open source? ðŸ˜Š

Here is the original changelog comment, which has been removed from the source code, but is preserved here to illustrate the contributions of the above projects:


```c
/* Sebsongs Modular Euclidean v. 1.2. Dec 2 2022.
 *  
 * Revision notes:
 * - Density can now be zero at all lengths.
 * - Trigger lengths are now around 10ms on all channels.
 * - Wake up from sleep with reset switch now available.
 * - Blink pattern for revision check added. LED 13 blinks 4 times (50ms ON / 200ms OFF).
 * - Renamed internal sleep function to "zleep" due to conflicts with Arduino Nano Every.
 * - Fixed bug where offset could go out of range and never resolve.
 * - Fixed bug where sequencer freezed when encoder switches were pressed and hold.

/* Old notes from Tom Whitwell and others.
 
  Instructions:

  -- Note: when first turned on, it runs automatically from a fixed speed internal clock until it receives
  a pulse at the clock input, after that it only triggers externally --

  When the rhythms are playing, the display flips between page 1 (steps 1-8) and page 2 (steps 9-16).

  Here's what the display shows...

  Row 1: What step is Output 1 playing
  Row 2: Output 1 Pattern (steps 1-8 or 9-16)

  Row 3: What step is Output 2 playing
  Row 4: Output 2 Pattern (steps 1-8 or 9-16)

  Row 5: What step is Output 3 playing
  Row 6: Output 3 Pattern (steps 1-8 or 9-16)

  Row 7: Which channel is selected

  - 2 dots on the left for Channel 1
  - 2 dots in the middle for Channel 2
  - 2 dots on the right for Channel 3

  Row 8: Current triggers

  1. Input trigger
  2. -
  3. Output 1 trigger
  4. Output 1 off-beat trigger (when Output 1 isn't playing
  5. Output 2 trigger
  6. -
  7. Output 3 trigger
  8. -

  - When you have Channel 1 selected and you rotate the N- and K- and Offset knobs,
  Rows 1 and 2 will respectively show the pattern length (N), pattern density (K) or Offset (O).

  The same goes for Channel 2 (Rows 3 and 4) and Channel 3 (Rows 5 and 6)

  - Rotating the Offset encoder clockwise rotates the steps up to one full rotation

  Example:

  X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - Original 16-step pattern (N = 16, K = 1)
  0 X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - Offset of 1
  0 0 X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - Offset of 2
  0 0 0 X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - Offset of 3
  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X - Offset of 15
  X 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - Offset of 16

  >>> Sneak-Thief's design notes <<<

  - Added Encoder library to stabilize encoder use
  - Cleaned up code a bit
  - Created schematic with input/output protection: http://sneak-thief.com/modular/tombolas-euclidean-0.7.png
  - Added reset gate input
  - Added Offset control
  - Added 10K pulldown resistor to switch outputs
  - Changed 15K resistors to 10K
  - Added more error checking for eeprom reads / values to reduce risk of crashes

  >>> Syinsi/THX2112's design notes <<<

  - Updated schematic and included PCB files. Check distribution folder for files.
  - Uses separate MAX7219 IC and 8x8 matrix's.
  - Transistor-driven outputs.
  - BAT54S dual-schottky input protection.
  - Isolated 1.5A 5V supply for led matrix.

  To do
  - Add CV control of N, K and Offset using analog pins 5,6,7
  - OR Add gate control of two pairs of N, K or Offset using analog pins 4,5,6,7

  >>> Tombola's original design notes <<<

  To do
  - Error checking for eeprom reads / values to reduce risk of crashes
  - Find cause of ocassional skipped beats?

  Done
  - Connect 'off beat' for channel 1 to the spare output
  - something causing channel 1 to stick - N changes don't appear
  - When N is turned down, reduce K accordingly
  - make tick pulse correctly
  - Fix drawing of beats  as beats are playing
  - binary display of K & N not right
  - remove serial print / debug routine
  - remove delay - replace with 'all pulses off after 5ms routine
  - Fix crashing issue with low n
  - channels 1 and 3 require tweak to start running
  - Display OK
  - Pulse in working up to audio rates
  - Got flashing working - system is outputting euclidean beats!
  - Integrate encoders & eeprom
  - Add encoder display - light up row as it's turning DONE
  - 3-way switch working
  - Active channel indicator
  - Sleep / wake system & animation
  - DONE Remove serial printing - slows down?

  TO DO:
  - Implement offset (added by Sneak-Thief)
  - Add reset outputs and input and button
  - Add CV control of N and K (and later Offset) using analog pins 5,6,7

  BUGS:
  - FIXED Still display issues - 1111 on the end of beat displays - seems not to be clearing properly
  - FIXED Display on beats where k=n - seems to show loads of binary 111 on the end
  - FIXED Fix the bottom row - currently output flashers reversed

  Hardware notes:

  Display:
  din = d2
  clk = d3
  load = d4

  Encoders:
  Encoder 1a - k / beats = d5
  Encoder 1b - k / beats = d6
  Encoder 2a - n / length = d7
  Encoder 2b - n / length  = d8
  Encoder 3a - Offset = d9
  Encoder 3 b - offset = d10

  Pulse outputs:
  1 = d11
  2 = d12
  3 = d13

  Switches / misc :
  reset switch = A1
  pulse input = A0
  spare jack out = A3
  encoder switch = A2  - 3 buttons share one analog input:

  10k resistor ladder around 3 push button switches
  +5v -- 10k -- switch -- 10k -- switch -- 10k -- switch -- 10k -- GND
  Other ends of switches going to Analog in 0 and also 10k to GND

  Order: [HIGHEST R] Offset, Length, Density, (unpressed) [LOWEST R]
